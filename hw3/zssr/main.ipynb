They leverage the fact that fully convolutional networks can be applied to varying spatial shapes of inputs. In fact, fully convolutional networks are actually trained on image patches of the networks receptive field's size. [Glasner et al.](http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~vision/courses/2010_2/papers/single_image_SR.pdf) show that patches recurr accross scales in natural images. Therefore, a network trained to perform super-resolution from shape $(H/2, W/2)$ to $(H, W)$ can in fact be used to perform super-resolution from shape $(H, W)$ to $(2 \\cdot H, 2 \\cdot W)$. The network learns to perform super-resolution on patches in specific scales, but can be used for inference over and over due to the patch recurrence across scales. This phenomena is used as self-supervision in this framework.\n","\n","The framework follows these steps:\n","1. Let $I$ be our input image.\n","2. Get $LR(I)$, a low resolution version of $I$ using the downscaling operation $LR(.)$ of some scale factor $s$.\n","3. Pass $LR(I)$ through a CNN $f_\\theta$ where $f$ is the network's architecture and $\\theta$ are the network's weights.\n","4. $f_\\theta$ produces a super resolution of $I$ - $SR(LR(I))$ of the same shape as the original image $I$. In other words, $f_\\theta$ learns to upscale the image by the scale factor $s$.\n","5. $f_\\theta$ is trained to produce images identical to the original image $I$, using the $L_1$ reconstruction loss between $SR(LR(I))$ and $I$.\n","\n","<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1IEHf9mibOiYWEAITrg1dRy4XR8wBO4Tb\" alt=\"zssr_3\" width=\"500\"> \n","\n","6. $f_\\theta$ is applied on $I$ and outputs $SR(I)$ - the upscaled version of $I$.\n","\n","<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=13kSEQneeHm0225kRgmnoHWTytx7E2voM\" alt=\"zssr_4\" width=\"350\"> \n","\n","Due to patch recurrence across scales, this process can be applied in a repetative manner and provide us any super resolution of $I$ of size $t \\cdot s$ where $t$ is the number of times we passed the input through $f_\\theta$. \n","\n","**NOTE:** Methods that use examples from a single image alone are coined as *Deep Internal Learning*.\n","\n","**NOTE:** Notice this work implicitly sets a bias - all SR images are bicubic interpolations of the LR images.
